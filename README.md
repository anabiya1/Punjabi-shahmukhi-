Morphological Analyzer Project
Project Overview
This project is a Morphological Analyzer built with Python, utilizing NLP and machine learning techniques to analyze and break down words into their morphological components, such as roots, prefixes, and suffixes.

Requirements
The project uses various libraries, including NLTK, pandas, TensorFlow, NumPy, and scikit-learn. The dataset for this project is stored in an Excel file, complete words.xlsx.

Dataset:
Complete words dataset of excel format is used and uplaoded in main branch.

Main Features
Data Processing: Reads word data from the Excel file and applies tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and other NLP preprocessing.
Model: Uses a neural network model with Bidirectional LSTM layers for morphological analysis.
Analysis: Provides detailed morphological structure and classification for each word in the dataset.
How to Use
Install the required libraries.
Load the complete words.xlsx file as the dataset.
Run the analyzer to view morphological breakdowns of words and classifications.
Future Enhancements
Planned improvements include expanded support for complex morphological structures and additional language support.
